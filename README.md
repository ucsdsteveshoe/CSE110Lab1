## Personal Info & Work History

Hello!

My name is Steven, I'm a 5th year Computer Science undergrad with a minor in Cognitive Science. I'm set to graduate UCSD at the end of this year in spring 2022.

I'm *originall*y from San Diego. I can struggle with interaction at times, but I like to be very socially oriented. Some of my hobbies include:

- Hiking / long walks
- Game Development
- Anime
- Staring at photos of myself
- Playing video games with my friends

I've interned for 3 different companies over the last 3 summers. In order, they are:

1. [The Naval Surface Warfare Center](https://www.navsea.navy.mil/Home/Warfare-Centers/NSWC-Port-Hueneme/), Port Hueneme
2. [KAB Laboratories](https://www.epsilonsystems.com/c5i/about-epsilon-c5i), San Diego (**this one was also part time over the schoolyear!**)
3. [RAM Laboratories](https://www.ramlabs.com/), San Diego

Most of my experience has been in full stack `Web Development`, however at RAM Labs I expanded my skillset to have even more specialization in `Design` and `Machine Learning`.
